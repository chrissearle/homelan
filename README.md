## Home Lan

Small utility app - used for creating dhcpd and bind config files. Probably uninteresting for almost everyone :)

### Hostnames

* For devices - describes the device
* For airports - ap-location
* For machines - we use a subset of names of Gigs from the Isles of Scilly - see http://history.scillyarchive.com/pilot-gigs
